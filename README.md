# Lora Image Cropper

Image Cropper is a simple Qt desktop application for cropping images. It allows you to load an image, crop it to a specific size, and save the cropped image to a file. It's a quick and convenient way to quickly prepare images for fine-tuning generative AI models with lora weights.
